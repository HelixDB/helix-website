As developers, we're always looking for ways to boost our productivity and write better code. Here are five essential tips that can help you level up your development game.

## 1. Master Your IDE

Your IDE is your primary tool – invest time in learning its shortcuts and features:

- ⌘ + P: Quick file navigation
- ⌘ + Shift + F: Global search
- ⌘ + B: Go to definition

> "The time you spend learning your tools is always worth it in the long run."

## 2. Automate Repetitive Tasks

Automation is key to productivity. Here's a simple example of a task automation script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Auto-deploy script
git pull origin main
npm install
npm run build
pm2 restart app
```

## 3. Take Regular Breaks

The Pomodoro Technique is excellent for maintaining focus:

- 25 minutes of focused work
- 5-minute break
- Repeat 4 times
- Take a longer 15-30 minute break

## 4. Write Self-Documenting Code

Good code is its own documentation:

```typescript
// Bad
const x = users.filter(u => u.a > 5).map(u => u.n);

// Good
const activeUsers = users.filter(user => user.age > 5);
const activeUserNames = activeUsers.map(user => user.name);
```

## 5. Use Version Control Effectively

Make your git commits meaningful:

```bash
# Bad
git commit -m "fixes"

# Good
git commit -m "fix: resolve user authentication timeout issue (#123)"
```
